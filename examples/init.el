  ;; how many of the bindings provided by Proof General you use,
  ;; there may be more convenient alternatives.
  ;; The following is an example rebinding every top-level keybinding
  ;; provided by `easycrypt-ext', including those accessing the
  ;; sub-keymaps for managing options and external executable commands.
  ;; If you also want to change the (relative) keybindings in the sub-keymaps,
  ;; use `(keymap-set <subkeymap> <binding> <command>)';
  ;; for example, (keymap-set ece-exec-map-prefix "x" #'ece-compile)
  ;; (keymap-set easycrypt-ext-mode-map "C-c C-p" #'ece-print)
  ;; (keymap-set easycrypt-ext-mode-map "C-c l p" #'ece-print)
